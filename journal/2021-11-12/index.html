<h2 id="hello-everyone-hope-you-are-doing-well">Hello everyone! Hope you are doing well!</h2>
<p>This journal entry is going to simply be an update to my website, and other things.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="new-e-mail-again">New E-Mail! (again)</h3>
<p>Yes, I know I got a new e-mail 2 entries ago, but shush.<br>
<a href="mailto:morg@morgs9.xyz">morg@morgs9.xyz</a>!<br>
If you have any questions, concerns, suggestions, or if you just wanna say hi, shoot me an E-Mail!</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="new-website-look">New Website look!</h3>
<p>I gave the website a bit of a facelift.<br>
I put the text in the center of the page, and I redesigned the <a href="/coolpeople">friends page!</a><br>
I hope it looks good!</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="new-website-host">New Website Host!</h3>
<p>My website is now being hosted on <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare Pages</a>! The reason I switched to Pages and moved away from Firebase is that it has automatic deploy when I push to <a href="https://github.com/Morg-S9/morg-website">Github</a>, and it doesn’t have a data cap!<br>
So now I can put big files on my website without worrying about a 350MB per day cap! I’m also going to be moving my domain name to Cloudflare Registrar soon because it’s cheaper there!<br>
<em>(only $8.50 a month compared to the $12-$13 a month on Namecheap)</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="future-plan-complete-overhaul">Future Plan: Complete Overhaul</h3>
<p>I’m planning on completely re-designing my website!<br>
I don’t know when I’ll start, or when it’ll be deployed, because I am still finishing up the W3Schools HTML Course, and I still need to do the CSS Course, But it is in the backlog.</p>
<hr>
<p>And that’s about it!<br>
Thanks for reading, and I hope you have a good day! &lt;3</p>
