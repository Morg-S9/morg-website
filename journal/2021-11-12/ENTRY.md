## Hello everyone! Hope you are doing well!

This journal entry is going to simply be an update to my website, and other things.
***
### New E-Mail! (again)
Yes, I know I got a new e-mail 2 entries ago, but shush.
[morg@morgs9.xyz!](mailto:morg@morgs9.xyz)
If you have any questions, concerns, suggestions, or if you just wanna say hi, shoot me an E-Mail!
***
### New Website look!
I gave the website a bit of a facelift.
I put the text in the center of the page, and I redesigned the [friends page!](/coolpeople)
I hope it looks good!
***
### New Website Host!
My website is now being hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com)! The reason I switched to Pages and moved away from Firebase is that it has automatic deploy when I push to [Github](https://github.com/Morg-S9/morg-website), and it doesn't have a data cap! 
So now I can put big files on my website without worrying about a 350MB per day cap! I'm also going to be moving my domain name to Cloudflare Registrar soon because it's cheaper there!
*(only $8.50 a month compared to the $12-$13 a month on Namecheap)*
***
### Future Plan: Complete Overhaul
I'm planning on completely re-designing my website!
I don't know when I'll start, or when it'll be deployed, because I am still finishing up the W3Schools HTML Course, and I still need to do the CSS Course, But it is in the backlog.
***
And that's about it!
Thanks for reading, and I hope you have a good day! <3
