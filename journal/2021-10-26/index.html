		<h2>
			Hello everyone!
		</h2>
		<p>
			Hope you're well.
		</p>
		<p>
			So updates to this journal have been... well... stagnant.
			<br>
			I apologize for that. It's just that writing these are hard. (Note that I actually code this website, I don't use a website builder.)
			<br>
			I also just haven't felt motivated to mess with my website lately. (Although this was most likely the fault of another issue I will get into now.)
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>
			Anyway, let's get some updates out the way.
		</h2>
		<p>
			First, you may have noticed that for the better half of a month, that my website, along with the other websites I've been hosting for people, have been down.
			<br>
			<br>
			Unfortunately, my shitty ISP's AUP (acceptable use policy), forbid hosting "public services" on their network. So shit like websites.
			<br>
			And I <b>REALLY</b> didn't want to be the cause of our internet getting cut, because where we live we only have two cable internet companies. Verizon, and Xfinity. (Both forbid web hosting.)
			<br>
			So, it was in my best interest to shut it down before that could happen.
			<br>
			<br>
			After that, I decided to leave it alone for a bit. However just yesterday, I decided to look into hosting providers, and found Firebase Hosting.
			<br>
			<br>
			Firebase Hosting is a service of Firebase, a service created by Google for back-end'ing web and mobile apps.
			<br>
			It does have a free plan, albeit with a quota of 360mb per day, but my website is fairly small, and Cloudflare Caching probably helps a bit, so it would work for me.
			<br>
			Setting it up was rather easy actually. Just download the CLI, login, initalize the directory you keep the project in, and deploy it.
			<br>
			You can also link custom domain names for free, which is pretty nice.
			<br>
			<br>
			So if you're like me, just making a small website to express yourself on, (and if you don't mind getting your hands a little dirty <i>cough cough</i> command prompt <i>cough cough</i> coding your own website <i>cough cough</i>), I'd 100% recommend Firebase. <a href="https://firebase.google.com">Check them out here.</a>
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Moving on, I put my website on Github!
			<br>
			If you wanna mess with it, give me suggestions on how I can improve, or just look at it, <a href="https://github.com/Morg-S9/morg-website">check it out here.</a>
			By the way, don't tell me how to make it look modern. Whenever I try to make those I just end up making it look like a shitty middle-school computer science project. Plus, I like the aesthetic.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Finally:
			<br>
			<a href="mailto:MorgS9@pm.me">New E-Mail.</a>
			<br>
			MorgS9@pm.me
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Aaaaand that about wraps it up! I hope you enjoyed reading it. I hope to make more of these in the future, but I'd keep your expectations on ground level.
		</p>
		<p>
			Anyway, have a good day, and thanks for reading!
